I lifted some code from other open-source projects in order to make
this package as self-contained as possible. I am particularly
grateful to the following people for sharing their code and saving
me a great deal of time:

- Mark K. King (for the free BSD-licensed getopt implementation)
- G. Jungman (for the implementation of the Hurwitz zeta function in GSL)
- Rene Brun (for the KolmogorovProb function in CERN's TMath library)
- Naoaki Okazaki (for the MIT-licensed libLBFGS library)
- Jerome G. Benoit (for the implementation of the first and second
		derivatives of the Hurwitz zeta function)
