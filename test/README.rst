Testsuite
=========

This directory contains input data for the testsuite.  In the future,
we should also write a testsuite based on the data.


Input data
----------

Below is a description of the input data for the testsuite.

* The data files ``celegans-indegree.dat``,
  ``celegans-outdegree.dat``, and ``celegans-totaldegree.dat`` contain
  the in-degree, out-degree, and total degree sequences, respectively,
  of the neural network of the C. elegans.  The degree sequences are
  computed from the dataset compiled by [WattsStrogatz1998]_, who in
  turn obtained the dataset from original experimental data by
  [WhiteEtAl1986]_.

* The data file ``condmat2005-degree.dat`` contains the 2005 update of
  the collaboration network of scientists posting preprints on the
  condensed matter archive at www.arxiv.org.  The network is weighted,
  with weights assigned as described in [Newman2001a]_.  The data
  should be cited as an updated version of the dataset used in
  [Newman2001b]_.  The network is undirected and we assume it has no
  self-loops nor multiple edges.  The degree sequence reflects these
  assumptions.

* The data file ``karate.dat`` contains the (total) degree sequence of
  the Zachary karate club nework, as described in [Zachary1977]_.
